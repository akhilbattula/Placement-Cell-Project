# Placement-Cell-Project
Notice boards is primary thing in any institution/organization and they rely on wooden notice boards hanging on the wall to display announcements, which is a difficult process as a separate person is required to take care of the display. Now time has come for notice boards to have a facelift. They need to be transformed into hi-tech notice boards. 

The prime objective of PLACEMENT CELL APP is to create a fully, fledged android application which would discover the Placement drives &amp;  job opportunities happening in and around the institution/organization so that no one will miss out the opportunities. PLACEMENT CELL APP has a largest collection of Placement drives &amp; job opportunities in and around institution reaching out to the active user.
